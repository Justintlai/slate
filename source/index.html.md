# Introduction

Welcome to the JWL API! You can use our API to access JWL API endpoints, which can get information on various products in our database.

We have language bindings in JavaScript only! You can view code examples in the dark area to the right, and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.

This example API documentation page was created with [Slate](https://github.com/lord/slate). Feel free to edit it and use it as a base for your own API's documentation.

# Authentication

> To authorize, use this code:

```javascript
  {
    "x-auth-token": "token"
  }
```

> Make sure to replace `token` with your uniquely generated token.

JWL uses Passport's `facebook-token` authentication process.

Once a user is verified by the Facebook Login process a `x-auth-token` is using JWT is generated and sent.

Here after, the token should be included in the header of each request to gain access to secured routes.

This should look something like this:

`x-auth-token: EAAZAKwmZC5Ki4BAD0fCZAZCyVQZ...`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>token</code> with your personal token.
